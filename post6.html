            And so I did.
          </p>
          <p>
            This week we are to add Google Analytics to a website we are managing to collect data on how the
            users engage with the site. I, of course, decided to add Google Analytics to this journal here.
            Here are some questions and my best guesses to these questions.
          </p>
          <h3>Questions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Who is coming to my site? Where are they coming from? What is the Bounce Rate?</li>
            <li>How did they get here?</li>
            <li>What is my most popular page?</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Best guess answers</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I would suspect mid-20s to late-30s. Basically classmates and friends who I bugged. I think
              my Bounce Rate would be pretty high. According to one of the additional readings for this
              week, blogs usually have a pretty high bounce rate and most visitors usually just check out
              the latest post.</li>
            <li>I would assume they arrived to my site from a link that was provided to them.</li>
            <li>I think the most popular would be the latest post. In this case, the Adding Accessibility
              post.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Setting up Google Analytics</h3>
          <p>
            The set up was pretty straightforward and I didn’t run into any complications. It was a little
            hard for me to understand everything by watching those videos the first viewing. It made a lot
            more sense when we had the little breakthroughs. I read the supplemental reading, Web Analytics
            Demystified and rewatched the videos and it made a lot more sense to me. It will still take me a
            long time to be close to mastering Google Analytics but we need to start somewhere.
          </p>
          <h3>Results</h3>
          <p>
            Who is coming to my site? What is the Bounce Rate?
            I am not expecting much just yet. I can’t imagine a lot of traffic to this page without me
            sending people links, which is what I eventually did.
          </p>
          <img src="img/4.png" alt="">
          <p>
            This is kind of what I expected. I only had 7 user, 6 of which were new. There were 10 sessions
            which averaged about 1.43 sessions per user. There were 15 pageviews and 1.5 pages per session.
            Finally, now I know how much my friends and classmates love me because I have an average of 1
            minute per session and an 80% bounce rate. I am not too bummed about he Bounce Rate because it
            is a blog.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don’t have any data for age or gender. It kind of makes me wonder if I did something wrong. I
            enabled Demographics and Interest Reports so maybe I need to wait for that information to get
            collected or it could be due to how low my traffic is to the site.
          </p>
          <img src="img/5.png" alt="">
          <p>
            All of my users are from the United States. One of the users I’ve asked to visit my page was
            from Holland but I think I remember him saying he was visiting the States.
          </p>
          <img src="img/6.png" alt="">
          <p>
            If I dig a little further I can see that most of the users are from a few cities in Washington
            State and one city is “not set”.

            How did they get here?
          </p>
          <img src="img/7.png" alt="">
          <p>
            According to the Acquisition Overview report, 5 of the 7 users were direct while 2 were social.
            This is due to a combination of texting my link to people and asking people on my program’s
            Slack page and messaging people on Facebook. I am not surprised by these results.
          </p>
          <img src="img/8.png" alt="">
          <p>
            What is my most popular page?
          </p>
          <img src="img/9.png" alt="">
          <p>
            Looking at the Behavior Overview report, aside from the main blog page, three pages each had one
            view: Usability Test, Evaluating Accessibility, and Adding Accessibility Video with Subtitles. I
            did notice from this report that there is a fourth page that is missing a title which I will go
            back and fix.
          </p>
          <h3>Conclusions</h3>
          <p>
            I have a long way to go to really evaluate Google Analytics on my page. This is a small piece of
            a much bigger puzzle. Through time I will understand how to collect data better but I will also
            need to keep asking individuals to visit my page and click around. I tried to come up with about
            five questions but I wasn’t quite sure what I could or wanted to collect. When I get a chance I
            may add some tags to these posts so this page may come up in a search. The post I have in mind
            is the one about Vinyl Me Please. Google Analytics isn’t as daunting when you start clicking
            around and understand what you are looking at. I had fun with this project.
