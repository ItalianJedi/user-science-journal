            Summary Report
          </h3>
          <p>
            For my final entry in my User Science Journal, I am going to summarize my goal and content experiments
            using Google Analytics.
          </p>
          <h3>Set Up and Goal</h3>
          <p>
            We learned how to set up Google Analytics by watching the set up videos by Google. I had to watch them
            twice to get a good idea of what Google Analytics is and how to utilize them. Our instructor also provided
            a couple walk throughs to help us get started.
          </p>
          <p>
            After setting up we were tasked to set up a Goal. The Goal I set up was was to get people to watch a video
            on accessibility called What’s New in Web Accessibility which is about a new auditing tool called
            Lighthouse that Google put in Chrome. I thought it was a very interesting discussion and very useful to
            this blog and class I am in. I started sharing the link on Slack and random people on Facebook. I even
            found a Web Accessibility group on Facebook which I joined and shared the link. I didn’t get very many
            people to click on it but was happy when I saw a couple people achieve my goal.
          </p>
          <h3>Content Experiments and Google Optimize</h3>
          <p>
            Next we were to set up content experiments to see how we can change the page to get more people to
            complete the goal. I ended up doing two experiments. The first one failed during set up so I was unable to
            see it finish it. Basically, I just made a new blog post linking to a new accessibility video. The second
            experiment was setting up Google Optimize. This wasn’t a very fun experiment because during set up I just
            changed the wording of the headline.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was trying to upload some screen caps but I am keep getting errors. Basically, the original headline was
            What’s New in Web Accessibility (Google I/O ’18) while the variant just took out (Google I/O ’18). Nothing
            groundbreaking or particularly interesting but the only thing I can really think of for a duration goal.
            Looking back I should have kept asking people to look at the video so I have more data to analyze.
            According to reporting in Google Optimize, where I see that there were two sessions for three days running
            (Google recommends two weeks) and in the improvement overview, the variant had one session.
          </p>
          <h3>Thoughts</h3>
          <p>
            I didn’t get many hits which I don’t believe was the point of this exercise. What we were trying to
            accomplish is understanding Google Analytics and how to set up Goals and Content Experiments. This is very
            important to a web developer even if they don’t use Google Analytics on a day to day basis. I think this
            will be useful for me when I enter the workplace and if I were to use it on personal projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Knowing that this page would most likely not get many views, I choose a goal that would be relevant to
            someone who is interested in User Accessibility. To make it easier for people to complete the goal, I
            choose a 5 minute mark for a successful completion. I know I wouldn’t get anyone to complete the goal if
            it was the full 20 unless someone came on here on their own because it is something they are really
            interested in it. And even if they were really interested in it, I am sure they will most likely have seen
            the video.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I could do this all over again, I would have used the other website I have which is a music blog. I
            think I will be able to get people to get to it and possibly get traffic without me begging them to come.
            This was really fun and I may even try it on my music blog when I get some free time. I would have also
            tried to promote this more so I get better data to analyze.
          </p>
