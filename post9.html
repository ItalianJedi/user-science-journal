          <h2>Mobile Usability Test</h2>
          <h3>
            Vinyl Me Please
          </h3>
          <p>
            This week we were asked to do the task as last week but using a mobile device instead. I had 3 participants look at the Vinyl Me Please website on my iPhone. Like before I had the users do a home page tour of the website to get a feel of it then I asked a few questions. I have since refined the questions.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Where can one learn more about Vinyl Me Please?</li>
            <li>Where would you look to find information about joining the club?</li>
            <li>How much does it cost to join Vinyl Me Please?</li>
            <li>If you received a record and don’t like it, is there a return policy?</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>
            Demographics
          </h3>
          <p>All participants in this test were in their early to mid 30’s and included two males and one female.</p>
          <h3>Home Page Tour</h3>
          <p>The users were not confused about this site being a Magazine like the testers in the desktop test. They knew it was a music website with a focus on records. They even noticed something joining the club, but nothing obvious about a record of the month club though one user mentioned they saw “Record of the Month.”</p>
          <p>Also, I got a lot of comments about how they like the flow of the site on a mobile platform. It was a lot more streamlined and “blockey” as one testers noticed.</p>
          <h3>1. Where can one learn more about Vinyl Me Please?</h3>
          <p>Testers were a little confused on how to learn more about Vinyl Me Please. While looking around one user said “no idea” and started clicking the social media buttons at the bottom of the screen. They all eventually saw the “About Us” at the bottom of the page.</p>
          <h3>2. Where would you look to find information about joining the club?</h3>
          <p>All users found the Join The Club button at the bottom of the page. The bottom of the page seems to be where the users start to go when they want to know more information about the page. One user actually clicked on the hamburger and saw Join The Club.</p>
          <h3>3. How much does it cost to join Vinyl Me Please?</h3>
          <p>All users, again, went to the bottom of the page and saw “Sign Up for $25 or Less.”</p>
          <h3>4. If you received a record and don’t like it, is there a return policy?</h3>
          <p>This one was a little harder for the testers. While they all went to the bottom of the page one user couldn’t find the return policy. One found information about swapping a record while the other found the return policy but said it was too long to read.</p>
          <h3>Analysis and thoughts</h3>
          <p>Same as with the desktop test, it was hard for some of the users to get an immediate idea of what the page was about. They knew that had to do with records but weren’t too sure if it was a club or not. When you click on the Join the Club page then it gets more obvious what the club is about. I would recommend that Vinyl Me Please try to make their front page obvious that it is a record of the month club like their Join the Club page. The first thing you see on the Join the Club page is “Get an exclusive record delivered monthly,…” Something like this should be a byline on the front page.</p>
          <p>I would think a business would want their About Us easier to find. It’s fine to have About Us at the bottom of the page but testers took a little longer than they should trying to find that information, especially when they were already confused as to the purpose of the page. I would add the About Us in the hamburger so it is easily accessible for the user.</p>
          <p>Also, as mentioned during the desktop test there is some slight contradictory information on this page. I am not going to go into specifics again but I would recommend they go through some of that information and make sure it is accurate. If you are going to advertise that plans start $25 or less but the lowest plan found is $29, you need to really update that information or else people are not going to trust your business.</p>
