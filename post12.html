          <h2>Analyze for Usability</h2>
          <p>
            For this project I want to conduct a little test to see how well I can navigate this website. Since this is a licensing website I decided to look at this site like I want more information regarding getting my license renewed. I would assume a regular drivers license is one of the main reasons why someone would go to the Washington State Department of Licensing website, so I want to see how easy it is to navigate the site.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>What’s clickable?</li>
            <li>Clearly Defined Areas</li>
            <li>Support scanning: short paragraphs, bullet points, highlight key terms, format text</li>
            <li>Noise</li>
            <li>Omit needless words: happy talk, instructions</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>What’s clickable?</h3>
          <p>On the front page there is a little arrow next to different sections that are clickable. For example, for Drivers there is a section for Get a driver license, renew your driver license, update your driver license/ID card, etc. When you hover over the link it changes from orange to white, letting you know it is clickable. The arrow is a confusing since I thought if I hover or click on the arrow I would get a list of options instead taking me to the next page. They can improve this by either getting rid of the confusing arrows or give you a list of options when you hover on the arrow. When you actually click on the section you come to a page with a list of options on the left side. It could help the user save time by clicking the link on the arrow instead of taking them to a whole other page to click the link.</p>
          <img src="img/27.html" alt="">
          <p>When you actually go to another page there is a lot of white pages with black text and obvious blue links.</p>
          <h3>Clearly Defined Areas</h3>
          <p>When I first log in I am given three options: drivers, vehicles and boats, and professions. It obviously looks like I need to go to the Drivers section of the website to get my renewal because I see it on the list of options underneath. If we didn’t have those options underneath then it could be a little confusing since I would also assuming drivers license renewal would be underneath Vehicles and Boats since I am renewing a license for driving a vehicle. It is also a little confusing when there are options for “Renew your driver license” and “Update your driver license/ID card” since it sounds like they do the same thing.</p>
          <img src="img/28.png" alt="">
          <h3>Support scanning: short paragraphs, bullet points, highlight key terms, format text</h3>
          <p>When on the home page the options given in each section makes scanning the options for each section fairly quick. I can see that if I were to try to get a commercial license I would go to the Professions section because they’ve used the word “professional” three times. Seeing words like tabs, buying and selling lets me know that this section deals with the vehicle itself instead of a drivers license, professional or not. The pages the information is on has a lot of bullet points and short sentences to get their point across. Even though they don’t have a lot of instructions there are a lot of bullet points per page and look like one large paragraph at first glance. It kind of takes a second for your eyes to get adjusted to the page.</p>
          <p>When I click on “Renew your driver license” I am shown a lot of options which takes me a second to figure out what’s going on. Even though they don’t have a lot of instructions there are a lot of bullet points per page and look like one large paragraph at first glance. It kind of takes a second for your eyes to get adjusted to the page. I would have assumed there would be an obvious link to renew but the first thing I see is something about REAL ID Act. They obviously want to draw your eyes to it since the put it in a box and something they deem important. The next section on the page is titled “Save a trip, skip the line, save some time!” which gives some criteria if you are able to renew your license online. Another example of how they want to draw your eyes to that section, but instead of putting a box around it they shade it pink which matches the pink box to the left.  Underneath all of this is a sea of black text and blue links. I understand they are trying to divide up the information in more usable chunks by making headlines in large bold font and making bullet points so you are not reading too much text. What bothers me is that it looks like they ran out of budget to make this part look somewhat pleasing to look at. As a matter of fact, I don’t even know what the other pages on this website looks like because I have no interest in seeing this again. Okay, I lied. After a couple of minutes I actually got a little curious and looked at other pages and sure enough, they all pretty much look alike.</p>

          <h3>Noise</h3>
          <p>There is not a whole lot in regards to noise, which is somewhat expected for a government website. You are not going to see any fancy animation or fantastic typography. Their job is to provide information, not to win any style awards. Saying that, the front page seems a bit cluttered. The colors orange, blue and green really don’t mesh well and while they are three colors they are very different colors and just looks like a mess. The only things I think are really needed for a front page is the jumbotron with whatever important information they want to draw your attention to, the section below that defines the general categories of information you will find on this site, and maybe the section below about office hours or list of forms and of course the footer which has a list of links you may need but not vital to the website. I would get rid of section that has tweets and featured videos. Again, this is a government website and most people don’t need have any distractions with tweets or videos. If they want those they can go to the appropriate area for them.</p>
          <img src="img/30.png" alt="">
          <h3>Omit needless words: happy talk, instructions</h3>
          <p>Other then being aesthetically unpleasing there is some important information made with bullet points and not a whole lot of text. You are not forced to read a thesis to get information about where you can get your license renewed. A website like this is helping a lot of people who need many different things. At times you are forced to deal with a lot of information that is not important to you but is needed for someone else. They could do a lot better with organization. There is nothing about this site that makes me want to stay longer than I should, which I guess is a good thing because I can’t imagine wanting to stay on a licensing website for longer than I have to. The only thing I would improve is to maybe consolidate some of the information. As I keep going through this there just seems like there is an endless amount of links on this site.</p>
