              Project: Goal Experiment Summary Report
            </h2>
            <h3 class="post-subtitle">
              Summary Report
            </h3>
            <p>
              For my final entry in my User Science Journal, I am going to summarize my goal and content experiments
              using Google Analytics.
            </p>
            <h3>Set Up and Goal</h3>
            <p>
              We learned how to set up Google Analytics by watching the set up videos by Google. I had to watch them
              twice to get a good idea of what Google Analytics is and how to utilize them. Our instructor also provided
              a couple walk throughs to help us get started.

              After setting up we were tasked to set up a Goal. The Goal I set up was was to get people to watch a video
              on accessibility called What’s New in Web Accessibility which is about a new auditing tool called
              Lighthouse that Google put in Chrome. I thought it was a very interesting discussion and very useful to
              this blog and class I am in. I started sharing the link on Slack and random people on Facebook. I even
              found a Web Accessibility group on Facebook which I joined and shared the link. I didn’t get very many
              people to click on it but was happy when I saw a couple people achieve my goal.
            </p>
            <h3>Content Experiments and Google Optimize</h3>
            <p>
              Next we were to set up content experiments to see how we can change the page to get more people to
              complete the goal. I ended up doing two experiments. The first one failed during set up so I was unable to
              see it finish it. Basically, I just made a new blog post linking to a new accessibility video. The second
              experiment was setting up Google Optimize. This wasn’t a very fun experiment because during set up I just
              changed the wording of the headline.

              I was trying to upload some screen caps but I am keep getting errors. Basically, the original headline was
              What’s New in Web Accessibility (Google I/O ’18) while the variant just took out (Google I/O ’18). Nothing
              groundbreaking or particularly interesting but the only thing I can really think of for a duration goal.
              Looking back I should have kept asking people to look at the video so I have more data to analyze.
              According to reporting in Google Optimize, where I see that there were two sessions for three days running
              (Google recommends two weeks) and in the improvement overview, the variant had one session.
            </p>
            <h3>Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
              I didn’t get many hits which I don’t believe was the point of this exercise. What we were trying to
              accomplish is understanding Google Analytics and how to set up Goals and Content Experiments. This is very
              important to a web developer even if they don’t use Google Analytics on a day to day basis. I think this
              will be useful for me when I enter the workplace and if I were to use it on personal projects.

              Knowing that this page would most likely not get many views, I choose a goal that would be relevant to
              someone who is interested in User Accessibility. To make it easier for people to complete the goal, I
              choose a 5 minute mark for a successful completion. I know I wouldn’t get anyone to complete the goal if
              it was the full 20 unless someone came on here on their own because it is something they are really
              interested in it. And even if they were really interested in it, I am sure they will most likely have seen
              the video.

              If I could do this all over again, I would have used the other website I have which is a music blog. I
              think I will be able to get people to get to it and possibly get traffic without me begging them to come.
              This was really fun and I may even try it on my music blog when I get some free time. I would have also
              tried to promote this more so I get better data to analyze.

                Project: Content Experiments
              </h2>
              <p>
                Last week we set up goals. My goal was to see if the user will watch a video on web accessibility for 5
                minutes. I thought it was an interesting video on an accessibility tool called Lighthouse that was added
                to Google Chrome. According to Google Analytics, two users completed that goal.
              </p>
              <img src="img/1.png" alt="">
              <p>
                This week we are to set up content experiments on our site. Content experiments are slight changes
                intended to have more people complete the goal. I tried to set up one experiment but was unable to get
                it set up correctly. Then our instructor showed us a different experiment to set up which seemed to work
                a lot better for me.

                Experiment 1:
                I made a new post with a different video than the Lighthouse one. This was also from the public archives
                and dealt with Web Accessibility.
                Accessibility Matters: Creating a Better Web

                I didn’t start this experiment due to an error I came across.
              </p>
              <img src="img/2.png" alt="">
              <p>
                It looks like I was able to complete the experiment but my instructor gave us a different experiment to
                run instead.

                Experiment 2: Google Optimize!
                Google Optimize is a new A/B test that Google has created. It will eventually replace the old way of
                doing content experiments so it is important that we are used to doing these types of testing.

                With this experiment, instead of using the Accessibility Matters video, the variant I set up was just a
                slight change in the title of the post. Instead of “What’s New in Web Accessibility (Google I/O ’18)” I
                just used “What’s New in Web Accessibility.” Other than sending the user to another video, I wasn’t
                quite sure how to set up an experiment that would be really useful for analysis. Luckily, I believe the
                goal of these projects is to demonstrate that we are able to set up these content experiments.

                The duration of the goal that I set up was three days and it looks like it had two experiment sessions,
                which was more than I expected.

                    Project: Gooooaaaal! (and Funnel)
                  </h2>
                  <P>
                    This week we are tasked to set up goals using Google Analytics.

                    I thought the set up was fine it just took me a little bit of time to figure out what my goal was
                    going to be. I used the tutorial from our class and from the Google Analytics tutorial on setting up
                    goals and funnels.
                  </p>

                  <h3>My Goal</h3>
                  <p>
                    For this project I want to track how long people watch this video called What’s New In Web
                    Accessibility. For roughly a half hour the presenter talks about automating web accessibility. I
                    want to track that in my post and send it out to as many people as I can.

                    The presentation is about a Google project about automating web accessibility called Lighthouse.
                    This project tests for SEO, best practices, and accessibility and has been integrated in Chrome Dev
                    Tools. The presenter goes through an interesting walk through of his auditing of a website using
                    Lighthouse. The video itself is 37 minutes but I want to see how long people watch the first section
                    about Lighthouse which is about 20 minutes. I do not believe that many people will watch the full 20
                    minutes but I do think there is enough interesting content where a user will watch the first 5
                    minutes.

                    The second part is equally as import which is about the Accessibility Object Model, proposed as
                    JavaScript API but for the purposes for this project I just want to focus on the first 5 minutes as
                    pertaining to Lighthouse.

                    The goal I set up is called Lighthouse – Goal Duration Test and I set the details to track the goal
                    of a duration of 5 minutes. Because it was a duration goal, I was unable to create a funnel since
                    those are just for destination goals.

                    I also added an id to the link to track the events whenever someone clicked on the link as opposed
                    to watched the video embedded on the page. I made the id of “lighthouse”.

                    I added the link to a couple of Slack channels though my school and am planning to send the link to
                    friends, family and other ways to generate traffic.
                  </P>

                    <p>
                      I found this to be pretty interesting and very relevant to the topic of accessibility. It is a bit
                      long but the first 20 minutes is about an auditing tool in Chrome Dev Tools called Lighthouse. It
                      is fascinating and well worth the watch if you are interested in the topic of web accessibility.

                      </h2>
                      <h3>Just Add Analytics</h3>
                      <p>
                        And so I did.

                        This week we are to add Google Analytics to a website we are managing to collect data on how the
                        users engage with the site. I, of course, decided to add Google Analytics to this journal here.
                        Here are some questions and my best guesses to these questions.
                      </p>
                      <h3>Questions</h3>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Who is coming to my site? Where are they coming from? What is the Bounce Rate?</li>
                        <li>How did they get here?</li>
                        <li>What is my most popular page?</li>
                      </ul>
                      <h3>Best guess answers</h3>
                      <ul>
                        <li>I would suspect mid-20s to late-30s. Basically classmates and friends who I bugged. I think
                          my Bounce Rate would be pretty high. According to one of the additional readings for this
                          week, blogs usually have a pretty high bounce rate and most visitors usually just check out
                          the latest post.</li>
                        <li>I would assume they arrived to my site from a link that was provided to them.</li>
                        <li>I think the most popular would be the latest post. In this case, the Adding Accessibility
                          post.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <h3>Setting up Google Analytics</h3>
                      <p>
                        The set up was pretty straightforward and I didn’t run into any complications. It was a little
                        hard for me to understand everything by watching those videos the first viewing. It made a lot
                        more sense when we had the little breakthroughs. I read the supplemental reading, Web Analytics
                        Demystified and rewatched the videos and it made a lot more sense to me. It will still take me a
                        long time to be close to mastering Google Analytics but we need to start somewhere.
                      </p>
                      <h3>Results</h3>

                        Who is coming to my site? What is the Bounce Rate?
                        I am not expecting much just yet. I can’t imagine a lot of traffic to this page without me
                        sending people links, which is what I eventually did.
                      </p>
                      <img src="img/4.png" alt="">
                      <p>
                        This is kind of what I expected. I only had 7 user, 6 of which were new. There were 10 sessions
                        which averaged about 1.43 sessions per user. There were 15 pageviews and 1.5 pages per session.
                        Finally, now I know how much my friends and classmates love me because I have an average of 1
                        minute per session and an 80% bounce rate. I am not too bummed about he Bounce Rate because it
                        is a blog.

                        I don’t have any data for age or gender. It kind of makes me wonder if I did something wrong. I
                        enabled Demographics and Interest Reports so maybe I need to wait for that information to get
                        collected or it could be due to how low my traffic is to the site.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        All of my users are from the United States. One of the users I’ve asked to visit my page was
                        from Holland but I think I remember him saying he was visiting the States.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        If I dig a little further I can see that most of the users are from a few cities in Washington
                        State and one city is “not set”.

                        How did they get here?

                      <p>
                        According to the Acquisition Overview report, 5 of the 7 users were direct while 2 were social.
                        This is due to a combination of texting my link to people and asking people on my program’s
                        Slack page and messaging people on Facebook. I am not surprised by these results.

                        What is my most popular page?

                      <p>
                        Looking at the Behavior Overview report, aside from the main blog page, three pages each had one
                        view: Usability Test, Evaluating Accessibility, and Adding Accessibility Video with Subtitles. I
                        did notice from this report that there is a fourth page that is missing a title which I will go
                        back and fix.
                      </p>
                      <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                      <p>
                        I have a long way to go to really evaluate Google Analytics on my page. This is a small piece of
                        a much bigger puzzle. Through time I will understand how to collect data better but I will also
                        need to keep asking individuals to visit my page and click around. I tried to come up with about
                        five questions but I wasn’t quite sure what I could or wanted to collect. When I get a chance I
                        may add some tags to these posts so this page may come up in a search. The post I have in mind
                        is the one about Vinyl Me Please. Google Analytics isn’t as daunting when you start clicking
                        around and understand what you are looking at. I had fun with this project.
