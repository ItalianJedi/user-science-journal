          <h2>Usable Design Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            For the purposes of practicing usable design analysis, I am going to look at <a href="https://theintercept.com/"> The Intercept</a> which is news and analysis from a left-wing perspective.
          </p>
          <p>The criteria I will be using for this project will be as follows:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Site id</li>
            <li>Page name</li>
            <li>Sections</li>
            <li>Local navigation</li>
            <li>You are here indicator</li>
            <li>Search</li>
          </ol>
          <p>I am going to use the trunk test where I go to a random page and analyze it. The random page that was chosen was the World page which contains articles about world events.</p>
          <img src="img/22.png" alt="">
          <h3>Site ID</h3>
          <p>The Intercept is clear at the top left corner of the page. When I surf around the site I always see The Intercept around the top left corner of the page. What I also like about the Site Id is the fact that it follows you while you move around the page. You still see that you are on The Intercept’s website with the site id and contents hamburger and it is still out of the way so you can view the page. I would cut down on the black box around the site id as it is fairly large and we can use that space for more page content. Not the biggest deal in the world but something to note.</p>
          <h3>Page name</h3>
          <p>The page name is World. Since this is a new and analysis website I know that World would mean this is where I can find world news. When I go to other sections I know what the focus of that section of the page will be. Given that World is such a huge topic, it would be nice to see some division of the world. For example, if we are deal with world news from Latin America, it would be nice to see World – Latin America at the top of the page.</p>
          <h3>Sections</h3>
          <p>The hamburger next to The Intercept logo will give me options to go to other areas of the web page like politics, justice, technology, etc. This is consistent for most pages of this site.</p>
          <img src="img/23.png" alt="">
          <h3>Local Navagation</h3>
          <p>There isn’t much for local navigation. It appears that they will provide you with the newest story that has to do with world events. Given that this is a news and analysis page, it would be nice if it was divided in different parts of the world. For example, the top story is about Brazil. It is difficult for me at this level of the site to find more stories about Brazil, Latin America, or even South America. Even if I click on the story itself, there are no keywords I can click on to give me more information about that story or stories similar.</p>
          <h3>You are here indicator</h3>
          <p>It is easy to tell where I am at in the web site. The name of the page is World so it is easy for me to know that I am in the World news section of the site. By clicking on the hamburger I can easily go to a different section of the site or even search for a topic of my choosing. As I think about this more I wonder if a navigation bar would be better use of this site than a hamburger. There is some empty white space above that the navigation bar can take up and easily display the different sections you can navigate to or a search bar at top you can use.</p>
          <h3>Search</h3>
          <p>As I mentioned in the local navigation, there is no real way for me to navigate to other stories similar to Brazil, Latin America, or South America. There is a search option when I click on the hamburger that is a magnifying glass. As a test, I am going to search for stories on Brazil. When I do I am given a list of 10 stories about Brazil. It even lets me know at the top of the page.</p>
          <img src="img/24.png" alt="">
          <p>For a news site, 10 stories on the country of Brazil doesn’t seem like very much. But then you realize that there are actually more and you have to scroll down to the bottom of the page to see “Fetching more” which means the page is finding more stories on Brazil. If I scroll back up I can now see there are 100 results for Brazil instead of the previous 10.</p>
          <img src="img/25.png" alt="">
          <p>This can be a bit confusing at first but I think they are banking on users to frequent the site.</p>
          <h3>Stretch Goal</h3>
          <p>I want to contrast this a little bit with BBC News. While more traditional of a website, on of it’s strengths is its organization. My criticism of The Intercept is that there is no sections when you are on the World page. With BBC you can click on World and section of the world: Asia, Africa, Europe, etc. This may also have to do with the scope of the news site where I am sure BBC has more reporters than the Intercept.</p>
