          <h2>Usability Test</h2>
          <p>
            We are tasked to create a usability test based on the test mentioned in Steve Krug’s book, Don’t Make Me Think. The website I want to test out was the website for Vinyl Me Please. Vinyl Me Please is a subscription based record of the month club where for roughly $30 you receive their choice for record of the month plus some art work and a cocktail recipe made for that particular record.
          </p>
          <img src="img/14.png" alt="">
          <p>I think this website is a fantastic idea for people who are music nerds and love discovering and listening to new music, especially on vinyl. Though I doubt I would join the club myself, I do like to look at it from time to time to see what records they feel are essential and maybe I will have a listen and eventually purchase it for my own collection.</p>
          <p>I wanted to see if people understood what this website was all about. I already knew about it so the content already made sense to me, but could people who were unfamiliar with it navigate around the page and understand what the web page has to offer?</p>
          <p>I asked three people to look at this site and had a couple tasks for them:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Do a homepage tour to get a feel for the website.</li>
            <li>Thinking of a service they would need that this website might help them with.</li>
            <li>How would they find information about a record.</li>
            <li>If interested, how would they join the club.</li>
            <li>Where would they look to find information about the website.</li>
            <li>If they can figure out the return policy.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Homepage Tour</h3>
          <p>For the first task, I asked my participants to take a look at the home page to get a general feel of the website and what would they click on first (but didn’t let them click on anything yet). They thought it was a nice looking website with lot of information about vinyl records and noticed a mention on the record of the month. I was told people would click on classics and essentials first. Another participant seemed interested in an article on Charles Mingus records.</p>
          <img src="img/15.png" alt="">
          <img src="img/16.png" alt="">
          <h3>Service This Website Might Help The User With</h3>
          <p>Since my participants knew Vinyl Me Please had to do with records they said this website could help you do research and get more information on music and vinyl. This is kind of an obvious question but it was interesting to note that no one really mentioned a subscription based service.</p>
          <h3>Searching For A Record</h3>
          <p>At this point I didn’t want to give away the main purpose of the website but everyone knew it was about vinyl records. I asked the participants how they would go about looking for a record and all mentioned a search bar. They then found the search bar, which wasn’t obvious to them. Two of them were unable to find a record they were looking for while one of them found theirs which happened to be a past record of the month. This might be confusing for some if they didn’t quite get the purpose of the website. While doing this task, one of the participants mentioned it almost seemed like a magazine and subscription-based website.</p>
          <img src="img/17.png" alt="">
          <h3>How to join the club</h3>
          <p>I finally let it be known that the purpose of this website is a record of the month subscription-based service. I wanted them to know so they can do the next task: figure out how to join. The purpose of this task was to see if they can figure out how to join and what perks do they get for joining. This was an easy task for them because there is a “Join the Club” button at the top of the page that is blue as opposed to the others which are black.</p>
          <img src="img/18.png" alt="">
          <h3>About Us</h3>
          <p>I kind of knew this may be an issue because the about section isn’t obvious. Two participates chose The Magazine at the top of the page as the about us. This shows that there is still a little confusion about the purpose of the page. All three eventually find the about us section at the bottom of the page but it took awhile and was not obvious to the user.</p>
          <img src="img/19.png" alt="">
          <h3>Return or Swap Out Policy</h3>
          <p>I think this is an important thing to note since this is on many peoples mind while joining a subscription based service. A few years ago I joined the New York Review of Books Book Club. It is a club where  you receive a book a month. Once I got a book that I had absolutely no interest in. I asked if I can return it to get something else. I was told I couldn’t do that. When you are spending $30 a month, it really needs to be clear what the return or swap policy is. No one really understood this policy. Basically, before the album gets sent to you, you are sent an email talking about this month’s selection. At the time you can actually change your mind and choose another record. But, if the record is sent to you, you cant return it, especially since it is open. It is explained  that the reason is of shipping costs. The information is not very clear and one can get easily confused with swapping out and returning. None of the participants didn’t quite figure it out, and even I found out that swapping out and returning were different during the test.</p>
          <img src="img/20.png" alt="">
          <p>In the Join the Club section we see that if we are not “feeling” the selection of the month we can swap it for a record that we do want.</p>
          <p>But</p>
          <img src="ing/21.png" alt="">
          <p>The return policy states that you can not return the records after they have been shipped. This can be confusing to the user but the page they are more likely to go on is the Join the Club page where they are told they can swap out a record they don’t love. It should be clear that the return policy takes into affect after the record has been shipped, which I hope the user gets and idea how long they can make that decision before it gets shipped.</p>
          <h3>Next Steps and Final Thoughts</h3>
          <p>For next steps I would suggest making some of these points clearer on the website. None of the participants really understood the website at first. They knew it had to do with records and music, but some of them got confused by the magazine aspect of the website thinking it was a focal point when in fact it is a record subscription club.</p>
          <p>I would put About Us at the very top of the page so the user can click on it to figure out what they are looking at if they had questions. Instead they had to go all the way to the bottom of the page to find it. I would also make it clearer that it is a subscription-based service in the jumbotron or somewhere on the front page which would be one of the first things the user sees. One of the users thought the links to join had to do with the magazine.</p>
          <p>On that note would also argue to put less emphasis on the magazine unless they want that to be equally important as the records. It seemed to confuse the users, especially since most of the contents on the first page seem to be columns and articles from the magazine. I would say to put more emphasis on the subscription part of the website, and maybe articles and info on the artists of the month. Less content on the front page as well, which a user mentioned there is too many articles.</p>
          <p>All thought it was interesting and a good idea. One even mentioned that they would come back and look through some of the articles at a later time. One participant first thought it was a nice looking website then changed their tune at the end of the test. I pointed out that it could be because they made it to look better on a phone or tablet. I showed her and she agreed.</p>
          <p>At the end of the day these suggestions may not be a real concern for Vinyl Me Please. When I see ads for Vinyl Me Please it is usually on vinyl based websites which usually do a good job explaining the purpose of the website. It would seem most visitors would already know what the website is about. This could explain why there may not be much of a need to have an About Us at the top of the page. While this may work for them I would suggest to cater this a little more to people who may not already know what the website is about. These are why I want to include the about us at the top, put less emphasis on the magazine and more on the subscription.</p>
